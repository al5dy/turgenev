[This plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/turgenev/) assesses the risk of falling under the "Baden-Baden" and shows what needs to be fixed. Enjoy :)
                                                       
Baden-Baden is Yandex's algorithm for detecting unnatural, over-optimized texts. If there is not a lot of low-quality content on the site, specific pages go down in the ranking. If there is a lot, the whole site will be filtered. Turgenev evaluates the risk of Baden-Baden in points, shows the problems and helps to cope with them.
                                                       
Plugin uses an [official "Turgenev" API](https://turgenev.ashmanov.com/?a=apikey).
